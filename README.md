# Cargo-like Makefile project

This is meant to feel like a freshly created cargo project, only for c++ projects.

The `main.rs` equivalent is `main.c++` all other files are called `.cpp` or `.hpp`. Build artifacts are supposed to land in `./target/debug`



## How to use

`make run`

`make clean`

## TODO

* [ ] there is no equivalent to `--release` yet
* [ ] so many more things I didn't think of yet
